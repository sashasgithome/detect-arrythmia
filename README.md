# Pattern Recognition Algorithm for Heart Attack Complication Risk Determination

### Purpose
To implement a classifer model capable of determining yes/no possibility of getting arrythmia complication based on symptoms from post heart attack hospital care data.

### Notes
The model is a KNN classifier that applies Random Forest for feature extraction/selection, with a 95% accuracy after evaluated through grid search cross validation. This project is inspired by the need for fast diagnosis of arryhtmia complication on a hospital patient admitted for heart attack, where doctors and users will receive an alert if the patient medical stats they inputtted are alarming. Possible improvements are to include more than simple binary classification and taking into account other complications provided in the dataset. <br>

Below would be how healthcare workers input some of the patient stats. <br>
